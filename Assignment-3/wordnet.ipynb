    "### About Wordnet\n",
    "Wordnet is an English language database that is used in natural language processing and is provided through the NLTK library. Wordnet's database contains relationships between words, such as a word's synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms, meronyms, and holonyms. It also has methods that can be applied to synsets, such as getting the gloss (definition) of a word, getting use case examples, and more."

    "WordNet is organizes nouns into \"synsets\", or sets of synonyms, which describes a word and the words that are closely related in definition to it. It then also has antonym relationships with other words to represent the opposite of a word, if it exists. It also has part-whole relationships, known as meronyms and holonyms, where a meronym is a part of of another thing and a holonym is the thing a word is a part of. It also has hypernyms and hyponyms, where a hypernym is a higher version of the word and a hyponym is a lower version of the word. These organized relationships exist to allow for ease of use and access when being used in the context of natural language processing."
