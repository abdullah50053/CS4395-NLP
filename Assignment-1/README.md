# Assignment 1

## Overview

This program reads in a CSV file with employee data, processes the text to be more standardized, creates objects for each person with corrections from the user, and outputs the information of every employee.

To run this program, simply set the argv value to the file path of the CSV data file, and run the program. Follow the prompts to fix any issues in the data, and the final result will be outputted.

Python is a great language for text processing, thanks to its robust standard library and packages available. It is also an easy language to code in. It is however, slow than other languages, and when working with very large data sets that could be an issue. 

Overall, the majority of the assignment was review, though I did learn about pickling and what it could be used for.
