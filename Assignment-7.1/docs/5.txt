budget cuts are expected to crash jobs jump to content the telegraph logo search icon budget cuts are expected to crash jobs formula one’s seven uk teams may have to cut as many as jobs under plans to reduce their budgets to a maximum of £m next year
analysis by the daily telegraph shows nearly two in five of the f workforce in britain are at risk as the international lockdown forces deep cuts
a £m spending limit was due to be introduced in but the team bosses agreed on thursday to reduce the cap by a further pc in a bid to keep teams afloat
the crisis has triggered the cancellation of nine races in the current season and driven down the revenue from sponsors and prize money
it has fuelled concerns that f’s minnows could be at particular risk as they stand little chance of winning but still have annual costs of more than £m
according to the teams’ latest accounts costs came to an average of £m in with the uk’s biggest spenders reigning champions mercedes having a budget of £m
after research and development salaries are the biggest expenses and the accounts show that the teams employ a total of staff who are paid £m
half of the teams have put staff on furlough and slashed driver salaries but even bigger cuts could be yet to come
zak brown mclaren chief executive told the bbc earlier this month that he “could see four teams disappearing” due to coronavirus and urged a budget cap of £m m to protect them
however ferrari reportedly opposed a cap below £m due to the redundancies it would require
even at that level pc of the total uk workforce of which is clustered in northamptonshire and oxfordshire are at risk
the estimate is based on data on staff costs from f team accounts reduced in line with the incoming budget cap
that figure was divided by the current average salary to yield the number of staff that each team would employ under the cap
employees who work on the design development and manufacture of the engines are excluded from the cap along with marketing staff and driver salaries
it is already on the teams’ minds as renault’s managing director cyril abiteboul recently warned
“if the top teams have to make hundreds of layoffs in light of the budget cap and we continue to pay the drivers several tens of millions per year i find that there is something not right about that” he said
personnel could possibly be relocated to roles within related companies as mercedes ferrari renault and mclaren all make road cars and mclaren and red bull have subsidiaries that work in other technology areas
alternatively staff could move into other areas of the automotive industry or other racing series
ultimately lower budgets should make f more sustainable and competitive
