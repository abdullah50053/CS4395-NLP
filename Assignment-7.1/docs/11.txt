the telegraph logo search icon jump to navigation max mosley makes dramatic u turn over his future as fia president the future of formula one was thrown into fresh doubt on thursday night when max mosley performed a dramatic u turn and threatened to stand for re election as president of world motor racings governing body
mosley is furious about the press coverage that followed wednesdays landmark peace deal with eight rebel teams which saw the year old promise not to seek re election for a fifth term as fia president and the formula one teams association agree to back down over plans to form a breakaway series
in a letter to ferrari and fota president luca di montezemolo seen by telegraph sport mosley accuses fota of falsely briefing the press that he had been forced out of office that fia senate president michel boeri had taken interim charge of formula one and that he had behaved like a dictator
this last accusation mosley described as grossly insulting to the members of the world motor sport council who have discussed and voted all the rules and procedures of formula one since the s he added in the letter sent before thursdays fota meeting in bologna if you wish the agreement we made to have any chance of survival you and fota must immediately rectify your actions
you yourself must issue a suitable correction and apology at your press conference this afternoon
given that no apology was forthcoming in fact fota on thursday called for a neutral successor to mosley a presumption which further enraged the fia it can be presumed that mosley will now re evaluate his position
i now consider my options open mosley concluded
at least until october i am president of the fia with the full authority of that office
after that it is the fia member clubs not you or fota who will decide on the future leadership of the fia
mosleys u turn is likely to be interpreted as the final desperate act of an angry man whose ego has been hurt but it also raises the distinct possibility that fotas breakaway series may be back on the table
one thing is for sure it does nothing for the reputation of the sport
