the fia formula one world championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 
the word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants cars must conform
a formula one season consists of a series of races known as grands prix
grands prix take place in multiple countries and continents around the world on either purpose built circuits or closed public roads
a points system is used at grands prix to determine two annual world championships one for the drivers and one for the constructors the teams
each driver must hold a valid super licence the highest class of racing licence issued by the fia and the races must be held on tracks graded the highest grade rating issued by the fia for tracks
formula one cars are the fastest regulated road course racing cars in the world owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce
much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car
the turbulence reduces the downforce generated by the cars following directly behind making it hard to overtake
major changes made to the cars for the season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars with the goal of making overtaking easier
the cars are dependent on electronics aerodynamics suspension and tyres
traction control launch control and automatic shifting plus other electronic driving aids were first banned in 
they were briefly reintroduced in and have more recently been banned since and respectively
with the average annual cost of running a team designing building and maintaining cars pay transport being approximately £ or $ its financial and political battles are widely reported
on january liberty media completed its acquisition of the formula one group from private equity firm cvc capital partners for £ or $
main article history of formula one formula one originated from the european motor racing championships of the s and s the formula consists of a set of rules that all participants cars must follow
formula one was a new formula agreed upon during with the first non championship races taking place during that year
the first formula one grand prix was the turin grand prix
a number of grand prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a motor racing world championship before world war ii but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict the world drivers championship did not become formalised until 
the first world championship race took place at the silverstone circuit in the united kingdom on may 
giuseppe farina competing for alfa romeo won the first drivers world championship narrowly defeating his teammate juan manuel fangio
however fangio would go on to win the championship in and respectively
this set the record for the most world championships won by a single driver a record that stood for years until michael schumacher won his sixth championship in 
a constructors championship was added in the season
stirling moss despite being regarded as one of the greatest formula one drivers in the s and s never won the formula one championship
between and moss finished second place in the championship four times and in third place the other three times
fangio however achieved the record of winning of the races he entered a record for the highest percentage of formula one races won by a single driver
this is a record he holds to this day
national championships existed in south africa and the uk in the s and s non championship formula one events were held by promoters for many years
however due to the increasing cost of competition the last of these was held in 
this time period featured teams managed by road car manufacturers such as alfa romeo ferrari mercedes benz and maserati
the first seasons featured pre war cars like alfas 
they were front engined with narrow tyres and 

litre naturally aspirated engines
the and seasons were run to formula two regulations for smaller less powerful cars due to concerns over the lack of formula one cars available
when a new formula one formula for engines limited to 
litres was reinstated to the world championship for mercedes benz introduced their w the w featured things never seen on formula one cars before such as desmodromic valves fuel injection and enclosed streamlined bodywork
mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the le mans disaster
the first major technological development in the sport was bugattis introduction of mid engined cars
jack brabham the world champion in and soon proved the mid engines superiority over all other engines and by all teams had switched to mid engined cars
the ferguson p a four wheel drive design was the last front engined formula one car to enter a world championship race
it was entered in the british grand prix the only front engined car to compete that year
during lotus introduced a car with an aluminium sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space frame design
this proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid engined cars
during brabham became the first team to show advertisements on their cars
this introduced sponsorship to the sport
five months later lotus followed brabhams example when they painted an imperial tobacco livery on their cars at the spanish grand prix
aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the late s during the late s lotus introduced ground effect aerodynamics previously used on jim halls chaparral j during that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds
the aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the cars weight
as a result extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height leaving the suspension virtually solid
this meant that the drivers were depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface
beginning in the s bernie ecclestone rearranged the management of formula ones commercial rights he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion dollar business it now is
when ecclestone bought the brabham team during he gained a seat on the formula one constructors association and during he became its president
previously the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually however ecclestone persuaded the teams to hunt as a pack through foca
he offered formula one to circuit owners as a package which they could take or leave
in return for the package almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising
the formation of the fédération internationale du sport automobile fisa during set off the fisafoca war during which fisa and its president jean marie balestre argued repeatedly with foca over television revenues and technical regulations
the guardian said that ecclestone and max mosley used foca to wage a guerrilla war with a very long term aim in view
foca threatened to establish a rival series boycotted a grand prix and fisa withdrew its sanction from races
the result was the concorde agreement which guaranteed technical stability as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations
although fisa asserted its right to the tv revenues it handed the administration of those rights to foca
fisa imposed a ban on ground effect aerodynamics during 
by then however turbocharged engines which renault had pioneered in were producing over kw bhp and were essential to be competitive
by a bmw turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 
bar psi pressure estimated to be over kw bhp in qualifying for the italian grand prix
the next year power in race trim reached around kw bhp with boost pressure limited to only 

these cars were the most powerful open wheel circuit racing cars ever
to reduce engine power output and thus speeds the fia limited fuel tank capacity in and boost pressures in before banning turbocharged engines completely in 
the development of electronic driver aids began during the s lotus began to develop a system of active suspension which first appeared during on the lotus 
by this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by ayrton senna in the monaco grand prix that year
in the early s other teams followed suit and semi automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression
the fia due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill banned many such aids for the season
this resulted in cars that were previously dependent on electronic aids becoming very twitchy and difficult to drive
observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only as they proved difficult to police effectively
the teams signed a second concorde agreement during and a third in 
on the track the mclaren and williams teams dominated the s and s brabham were also being competitive during the early part of the s winning two drivers championships with nelson piquet
powered by porsche honda and mercedes benz mclaren won sixteen championships seven constructors and nine drivers in that period while williams used engines from ford honda and renault to also win sixteen titles nine constructors and seven drivers
the rivalry between racers ayrton senna and alain prost became fs central focus during and continued until prost retired at the end of 
senna died at the san marino grand prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve tamburello
the fia worked to improve the sports safety standards since that weekend during which roland ratzenberger also died in an accident during saturday qualifying
no driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a formula one car for years until the japanese grand prix where jules bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit dying nine months later from his injuries
since three track marshals have died one at the italian grand prix the second at the australian grand prix and the third at the canadian grand prix
since the deaths of senna and ratzenberger the fia has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise under the concorde agreement would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams most notably the changes introduced for 
this so called narrow track era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres a narrower track overall and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip
the objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track
this according to the fia was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety
results were mixed as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip
this resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices which in turn resulted in less overtaking as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or dirty
this prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on clean air to make the car stick to the track
the grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well
drivers from mclaren williams renault formerly benetton and ferrari dubbed the big four won every world championship from to 
the teams won every constructors championship from to as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the constructors championship in every season between and and winning every race but one the monaco grand prix between and 
due to the technological advances of the s the cost of competing in formula one increased dramatically thus increasing financial burdens
this combined with the dominance of four teams largely funded by big car manufacturers such as mercedes benz caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business
this effectively forced several teams to withdraw
during this period the championship rules were changed frequently by the fia with the intention of improving the on track action and cutting costs
team orders legal since the championship started during were banned during after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results generating negative publicity most famously by ferrari at the austrian grand prix
other changes included the qualifying format the points scoring system the technical regulations and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last
a tyre war between suppliers michelin and bridgestone saw lap times fall although at the united states grand prix at indianapolis seven out of ten teams did not race when their michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use leading to bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to formula one for the season by default
bridgestone then went on to sign a contract on december that officially made them the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons
during max mosley outlined a green future for formula one in which efficient use of energy would become an important factor
starting in with fords purchase of stewart grand prix to form the jaguar racing team new manufacturer owned teams entered formula one for the first time since the departure of alfa romeo and renault at the end of 
by the manufacturer teams renault bmw toyota honda and ferrari dominated the championship taking five of the first six places in the constructors championship
the sole exception was mclaren which at the time was part owned by mercedes benz
through the grand prix manufacturers association gpma the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of formula ones commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport
in and honda bmw and toyota all withdrew from formula one racing within the space of a year blaming the economic recession
this resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance within the sport
the honda f team went through a management buyout to become brawn gp with ross brawn and nick fry running and owning the majority of the organisation
brawn gp laid off hundreds of employees but eventually won the years world championships
bmw f was bought out by the original founder of the team peter sauber
the lotus f team were another formerly manufacturer owned team that reverted to privateer ownership together with the buy out of the renault team by genii capital investors
a link with their previous owners still survived however with their car continuing to be powered by a renault engine until 
the three teams that debuted in hispania racing f teamhrt formula team lotus racingteam lotuscaterham f team and virgin racingmarussia virgin racingmarussia f teammanor marussia f teammanor racing mrt all disappeared within seven years of their debuts mclaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from mercedes benz mclarens partnership with mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the mclaren mercedes slr road car project and tough f championships which included mclaren being found guilty of spying on ferrari
hence during the season mercedes benz re entered the sport as a manufacturer after its purchase of brawn gp and split with mclaren after seasons with the team
during the season of formula one the sport was gripped by the fiafota dispute
the fia president max mosley proposed numerous cost cutting measures for the following season including an optional budget cap for the teams teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom adjustable front and rear wings and an engine not subject to a rev limiter
the formula one teams association fota believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a two tier championship and thus requested urgent talks with the fia
however talks broke down and fota teams announced with the exception of williams and force india that they had no choice but to form a breakaway championship series
on june an agreement was reached between formula ones governing body and the teams to prevent a breakaway series
it was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early s within two years exact figures were not specified and max mosley agreed he would not stand for re election to the fia presidency in october
following further disagreements after max mosley suggested he would stand for re election fota made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued
on july fota issued a press release stating they had been informed they were not entered for the season and an fia press release said the fota representatives had walked out of the meeting
on august it was announced fia and fota had signed a new concorde agreement bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sports future until 
to compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams four new teams were accepted entry into the season ahead of a much anticipated cost cap
entrants included a reborn team lotus which was led by a malaysian consortium including tony fernandes the boss of air asia hispania racing the first spanish formula one team as well as virgin racing richard bransons entry into the series following a successful partnership with brawn the year before
they were also joined by the us f team which planned to run out of the united states as the only non european based team in the sport
financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid
despite the entry of these new teams the proposed cost cap was repealed and these teams who did not have the budgets of the midfield and top order teams ran around at the back of the field until they inevitably collapsed hrt in caterham formerly lotus in and manor formerly virgin then marussia having survived falling into administration in went under at the end of 
a major rule shake up in saw the 
litre naturally aspirated v engines replaced by 
litre turbocharged hybrid power units
this prompted honda to return to the sport in as the championships fourth engine manufacturer
mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shake up with lewis hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate nico rosberg with the team winning out of the races that season
in ferrari was the only challenger to mercedes with vettel taking victory in the three grands prix mercedes did not win
in the season haas f team joined the grid
the season began in dominant fashion for nico rosberg winning the first grands prix
his charge was halted by max verstappen who took his maiden win in spain in his debut race for red bull
after that the reigning champion lewis hamilton decreased the point gap between him and rosberg to only one point before taking the championship lead heading into the summer break
following the break the positioning remained constant until an engine failure for hamilton in malaysia left rosberg in a commanding lead that he would not relinquish in the remaining races
having won the title by a mere points rosberg retired from formula one at seasons end becoming the first driver since alain prost in to retire after winning the drivers championship
this era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport
after hondas return as an engine manufacturer in renault came back as a team in after buying back the lotus f team
in aston martin and alfa romeo became red bull and saubers title sponsors respectively
sauber was rebranded as alfa romeo racing for the season while racing point part owner lawrence stroll bought a stake in aston martin to rebrand the racing point team as aston martin for 
in august a new concorde agreement was signed by all ten f teams committing them to the sport until including a $m budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development in the future
the covid pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations
a significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the season was pushed back to with constructors instead using their chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified was introduced
the start of the season was delayed by several months and both it and seasons were subject to several postponements cancellations and rescheduling of races due to the shifting restrictions on international travel
many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing
mercedes dominance began to be challenged by red bull in with the drivers championship going to red bull driver max verstappen after a controversial finish at the abu dhabi grand prix
in a major rule and car design change was announced by the f governing body intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects new aerodynamics larger wheels with low profile tires and redesigned nose and wing regulations
the constructors and drivers championships were won by red bull and verstappen respectively
this marked the end of a dominant era for mercedes and hamilton with mercedes finishing rd and hamilton finishing th with the first winless season in his career
main articles formula one racing formula one tyres racing flags and formula one regulationsa formula one grand prix event spans a weekend
it typically begins with two free practice sessions on friday and one free practice on saturday
additional drivers commonly known as third drivers are allowed to run on fridays but only two cars may be used per team requiring a race driver to give up their seat
a qualifying session is held after the last free practice session
this session determines the starting order for the race on sunday
each driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry weather tyres four sets of intermediate tyres and three sets of wet weather tyres during a race weekend
for much of the sports history qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time with the grid order determined by each drivers best single lap with the fastest getting first place on the grid referred to as pole position
from to the format was a one hour shootout
this approach lasted until the end of before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on
grids were generally limited to cars if the race had more entries qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race
during the early s the number of entries was so high that the worst performing teams had to enter a pre qualifying session with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session
the qualifying format began to change in the early s with the fia experimenting with limiting the number of laps determining the aggregate time over two sessions and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap
the current qualifying system was adopted in the season
known as knock out qualifying it is split into three periods known as q q and q in each period drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period with the slowest drivers being knocked out of qualification but not necessarily the race at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times
drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period
after each period all times are reset and only a drivers fastest lap in that period barring infractions counts
any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that drivers placement
the number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship
currently with cars q runs for minutes and eliminates the slowest five drivers
during this period any driver whose best lap takes longer than % of the fastest time in q will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards
otherwise all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions
this rule does not affect drivers in q or q in q the remaining drivers have minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period
finally q lasts minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions
at the beginning of the formula season the fia introduced a new qualifying format whereby drivers were knocked out every seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session
the aim was to mix up grid positions for the race but due to unpopularity the fia reverted to the above qualifying format for the chinese gp after running the format for only two races
each car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in q the cars that qualify for q must return them after q the cars that do not qualify for q can use them during the race
as of all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the grand prix whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in q had free tyre choice for the start of the race
any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying
grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current grand prix or for changing a gearbox or engine component
if a car fails scrutineering the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards discretion
the race begins with a warm up lap after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified
this lap is often referred to as the formation lap as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground
the warm up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start
once all the cars have formed on the grid after the medical car positions itself behind the pack a light system above the track indicates the start of the race five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time typically less than seconds to signal the start of the race
the start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position signalled by raising their arm
if this happens the procedure restarts a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid
the race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions with the original start voided
the race may be started from behind the safety car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous such as extremely heavy rainfall
as of the season there will always be a standing restart
if due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary then after the track has dried sufficiently drivers will form up for a standing start
there is no formation lap when races start behind the safety car
under normal circumstances the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps
race officials may end the race early putting out a red flag due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall and it must finish within two hours although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race
when a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it the red flag is deployed since a ten minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown
in the s race distances varied from km mi to km mi
the maximum race length was reduced to km mi in and km mi in 
the race length was standardised to the current km mi in 
however street races like monaco have shorter distances to keep under the two hour limit
drivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race
if a leader comes across a backmarker slower car who has completed fewer laps the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them
the slower car is said to be lapped and once the leader finishes the race is classified as finishing the race one lap down
a driver can be lapped numerous times by any car in front of them
a driver who fails to complete more than % of the race distance is shown as not classified in the results
throughout the race drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage from to inclusive they could also refuel
different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their cars potential
three dry tyre compounds with different durability and adhesion characteristics are available to drivers
over the course of a race drivers must use two of the three available compounds
the different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make
different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls this allows spectators to understand the strategies
under wet conditions drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves one intermediate for mild wet conditions such as after recent rain one full wet for racing in or immediately after rain
a driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds up to three stops are typically made although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change
if rain tyres are used drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres
race director this role involves generally managing the logistics of each f grand prix inspecting cars in parc fermé before a race enforcing fia rules and controlling the lights which start each race
as the head of the race officials the race director also plays a large role in sorting disputes among teams and drivers
penalties such as drive through penalties and stop and go penalties demotions on a pre race start grid race disqualifications and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations
as of the race directors are niels wittich and eduardo freitas on an alternating basis with herbie blash as a permanent advisor

the format of the race has changed little through formula ones history
the main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops
in the early days of grand prix racing a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammates car should theirs develop a problem in the modern era cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible
in recent years the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations
since the season refuelling which was reintroduced in has not been allowed to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns
the rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in again to encourage racing on the track
the safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience
main article list of formula one world championship points scoring systems st nd rd th th th th th th th * *a driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race
if the driver who set the fastest lap finishes outside of the top ten then the point for fastest lap will not be awarded for that race
various systems for awarding championship points have been used since 
the current system in place since awards the top ten cars points in the drivers and constructors championships with the winner receiving points
all points won at each race are added up and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned world champions
regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season or switches teams all points earned by them count for the drivers championship
a driver must be classified in order to receive points as of update a driver must complete at least % of the race distance in order to receive points
therefore it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race
from some time between the and seasons to the end of the season if less than % of the race laps were completed by the winner then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors
this has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the season
the last occurrence was at the belgian grand prix when the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car due to torrential rain
the half points rule was replaced by a distance dependent gradual scale system for

since formula one teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete and consequently the distinction between the terms team and constructor became less pronounced though engines may still be produced by a different entity
this requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the indycar series which allows teams to purchase chassis and spec series such as formula which require all cars be kept to an identical specification
it also effectively prohibits privateers which were common even in formula one well into the s the sports debut season saw eighteen teams compete but due to high costs many dropped out quickly
in fact such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of formula one that formula two cars were admitted to fill the grids
ferrari is the oldest formula one team the only still active team which competed in 
early manufacturer involvement came in the form of a factory team or works team that is one owned and staffed by a major car company such as those of alfa romeo ferrari or renault
ferrari holds the record for having won the most constructors championships sixteen
companies such as climax repco cosworth hart judd and supertec which had no direct team affiliation often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them
in the early years independently owned formula one teams sometimes also built their engines though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as bmw ferrari honda mercedes benz renault and toyota whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive
cosworth was the last independent engine supplier
it is estimated the major teams spend between € and € million $$ million per year per manufacturer on engines alone
in the season for the first time since the rule two teams used chassis built by other teams
super aguri started the season using a modified honda racing ra chassis used by honda the previous year while scuderia toro rosso used the same chassis used by the parent red bull racing team which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary
the usage of these loopholes was ended for with the publication of new technical regulations which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis the regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third party an option used by the hrt team in and haas currently
although teams rarely disclose information about their budgets it is estimated they range from us$ million to us$ million each
entering a new team in the formula one world championship requires a $ million up front payment to the fia which is then shared equally among the existing teams
as a consequence constructors desiring to enter formula one often prefer to buy an existing team bars purchase of tyrrell and midlands purchase of jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had such as tv revenue
seven out of the ten teams competing in formula are based close to london in an area centred around oxford
ferrari have both their chassis and engine assembly in maranello italy

a team may also run two additional drivers in free practice sessions which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a formula one driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car
most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season with driver changes taking place in between seasons in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race
each competitor must be in the possession of a fia super licence to compete in a grand prix which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved kilometres mi of running in a formula one car
drivers may also be issued a super licence by the world motor sport council if they fail to meet the criteria
although most drivers earn their seat on ability commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands
teams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the teams car although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers role mainly takes places on a simulator such as rfactor pro which is used by most of the f teams
each driver chooses an unassigned number from to excluding which was retired following the death of jules bianchi upon entering formula one and keeps that number during their time in the series
the number one is reserved for the reigning drivers champion who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one
at the onset of the championship numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race
permanent numbers were introduced in to take effect in when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the constructors championship standings at the end of the season
the teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the world drivers champion which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champions team
new entrants were allocated spare numbers with the exception of the number which had been unused since 
as teams kept their numbers for long periods of time car numbers became associated with a team such as ferraris and 
a different system was used from to at the start of each season the current drivers champion was designated number one their teammate number two and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous seasons constructors championship order
as of the conclusion of the championshipupdate a total of separate drivers have won the world drivers championship with michael schumacher and lewis hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven
lewis hamilton achieved the most race wins too in 
jochen rindt is the only posthumous world champion after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the italian grand prix with races still remaining in the season
drivers from the united kingdom have been the most successful in the sport with championships among drivers and wins
most f drivers start in kart racing competitions and then come up through traditional european single seater series like formula ford and formula renault to formula and finally the gp series
gp started in replacing formula which itself had replaced formula two as the last major stepping stone into f gp was rebranded as the fia formula championship in 
most champions from this level graduate into f but gp champion lewis hamilton became the first f f or gp champion to win the formula one drivers title in 
drivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering formula one
british f has supplied many f drivers with champions including nigel mansell ayrton senna and mika häkkinen having moved straight from that series to formula one and max verstappen made his f debut following a single season in european f more rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level as was the case with world champion kimi räikkönen who went straight from formula renault to f american open wheel car racing has also contributed to the formula one grid
cart champions mario andretti and jacques villeneuve became f world champions while juan pablo montoya won seven races in f other cart also known as champcar champions like michael andretti and alessandro zanardi won no races in f other drivers have taken different paths to f damon hill raced motorbikes and michael schumacher raced in sports cars albeit after climbing through the junior single seater ranks
former f driver paul di resta raced in dtm until he was signed with force india in 
see also list of formula one grands prix the number of grands prix held in a season has varied over the years
the inaugural world championship season comprised only seven races while the season contained races
there were no more than grands prix per season during the early decades of the championship although a large number of non championship formula one events also took place
the number of grands prix increased to an average of to by the late s while non championship events ended in 
more grands prix began to be held in the s and recent seasons have seen an average of races
in and the calendar peaked at events the highest number of world championship races in one season
six of the original seven races took place in europe the only non european race that counted towards the world championship in was the indianapolis which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the united states grand prix
the f championship gradually expanded to other non european countries
argentina hosted the first south american grand prix in and morocco hosted the first african world championship race in 
asia and oceania followed japan in and australia in and the first race in the middle east was held in 
the races of the season were spread over every populated continent except for africa with grands prix held outside europe
some of the grands prix pre date the formation of the world championship such as the french grand prix and were incorporated into the championship as formula one races in 
the british and italian grands prix are the only events to have been held every formula one season other long running races include the belgian german and french grands prix
the monaco grand prix was first held in and has run continuously since with the exception of and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world
all grands prix have traditionally been run during the day until the inaugural singapore grand prix hosted the first formula one night race in which was followed by the daynight abu dhabi grand prix in and the bahrain grand prix which converted to a night race in 
other grands prix in asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the european television audience

the pit lane where the drivers stop for tyres aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs such as changing the cars nose due to front wing damage during the race retirements from the race and where the teams work on the cars before the race is normally located next to the starting grid
the layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction
those few circuits that run anticlockwise and therefore have predominantly left handed corners can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by f cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal
a single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least visitors
most of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition
the current street circuits are monaco melbourne singapore baku miami and jeddah although races in other urban locations come and go las vegas and detroit for example and proposals for such races are often discussed most recently las vegas
the glamour and history of the monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks
three time world champion nelson piquet famously described racing in monaco as like riding a bicycle around your living room
circuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated as exemplified by the bahrain international circuit added in and designed like most of fs new circuits by hermann tilke
several of the new circuits in f especially those designed by tilke have been criticised as lacking the flow of such classics as spa francorchamps and imola
his redesign of the hockenheim circuit in germany for example while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections
these newer circuits however are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern formula one better than the older ones
the circuit of the americas in austin the sochi autodrom in sochi and the baku city circuit in azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 
in algarve international circuit debuted on the f calendar as the venue of the portuguese grand prix with the country having last hosted a race in a in circuit zandvoort returned to the f calendar as the dutch grand prix having last hosted a race in 
main articles formula one car formula one engines and formula one tyres modern formula one cars are mid engined hybrid semi open cockpit open wheel single seaters
the chassis is made largely of carbon fibre composites rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong
the whole car including the driver but not fuel weighs only kg lb the minimum weight set by the regulations
if the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight
the race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer
the cornering speed of formula one cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate which pushes the car down onto the track
this is provided by wings mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car
the aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance
the previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets barge boards and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over under and around the car
the other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres
from to the tyres in formula one were not slicks tyres with no tread pattern as in most other circuit racing series
instead each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars
slick tyres returned to formula one in the season
suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis one exception being that of the specification red bull racing car rb which used pullrod suspension at the rear the first car to do so since the minardi ps in 
ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their car
both ferrari f and mclaren mp of the season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear
in mclaren mcl and red bull racing rb switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension
carbon carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance
these provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula
in the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence commonly referred to as dirty air produced by the aerodynamics of the car
this includes a redesigned front and rear wing larger wheels with a lower tyre profile wheel covers small winglets the banning of barge boards and the reintroduction of ground effect downforce production
these have been changed to promote racing meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car
it allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance without extending the gap due to the turbulent air
see formula one world championship technical regulations formula one cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the fia
magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction
as of the wheels are covered with spec standardised wheel covers the wheel diametre has increased from inches to inches reducing the tyre profile and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres
starting with the formula season the engines have changed from a 
litre naturally aspirated v to turbocharged 
litre v power units
these get a significant amount of their power from electric motors
in addition they include a lot of energy recovery technology
engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol
the oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water
the generation of engines spun up to rpm and produced over kw bhp
for engines were restricted to rpm with limited development areas allowed following the engine specification freeze since the end of 
for the formula one season the engines were further restricted to rpm
a wide variety of technologies including active suspension are banned under the current regulations
despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of kmh mph at some circuits
the highest straight line speed recorded during a grand prix was 

mph set by juan pablo montoya during the italian grand prix
a bar honda formula one car running with minimum downforce on a runway in the mojave desert achieved a top speed of kmh mph in 
according to honda the car fully met the fia formula one regulations
even with the limitations on aerodynamics at kmh mph aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car and the oft repeated claim that formula one cars create enough downforce to drive on the ceiling while possible in principle has never been put to the test

times the cars weight can be achieved at full speed
the downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 
times that of the force of gravity g in cornering
consequently the drivers head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of kg in corners
such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race
a high performance road car like the enzo ferrari only achieves around g as of update each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time
each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team
if more engines are used they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used
the only exception is where the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season in which case up to five may be used by a driver
each driver may use no more than one gearbox for six consecutive events every unscheduled gearbox change requires the driver to drop five places on the grid unless they failed to finish the previous race due to reasons beyond the teams control
as of update each driver is limited to three power units per season before incurring grid penalties
this section needs to be updated
the reason given is needs update to account for the ban in private testing and cost caps estimated budget split of a formula one team based on the season in march f racing published its annual estimates of spending by formula one teams
the total spending of all eleven teams in was estimated at $

this was broken down as follows toyota $

m mclaren $ m honda $
m bmw sauber $ m renault $ m red bull $ m williams $
m midland fspyker mf $ m toro rosso $ m and super aguri $ million
costs vary greatly from team to team
honda toyota mclaren mercedes and ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately $ million on engines in renault spent approximately $ million and cosworths v was developed for $ million
in contrast to the season on which these figures are based the sporting regulations banned all performance related engine development
formula one teams pay entry fees of $ plus $ per point scored the previous year or $ per point for the winner of the constructors championship
formula one drivers pay a fia super licence fee which in was € plus € per point
there have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams
the smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared favouring established top teams
in september force india and sauber officially lodged a complaint with the european union against formula one questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful
the cost of building a brand new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars while the cost of converting a public road such as albert park into a temporary circuit is much less
permanent circuits however can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races such as motogp
the shanghai international circuit cost over $ million and the istanbul park circuit cost $ million to build
a number of formula one drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing
the highest paid driver in is lewis hamilton who received $ million in salary from mercedes amg petronas f a record for any driver
the very top formula one drivers get paid more than indycar or nascar drivers however the earnings immediately fall off after the top three f drivers and the majority of nascar racers will make more money than their f counterparts
most top indycar drivers are paid around a tenth of their formula one counterparts
in the second quarter of formula one reported a loss revenue of $ million and an income of $ million
this was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the covid pandemic
the company grossed revenues of $ million for the same quarter the previous year
the expense of formula one has seen the fia and the formula one commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport
following their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in liberty media announced their vision for the future of formula one at the bahrain grand prix
the proposal identified five key areas including streamlining the governance of the sport emphasising cost effectiveness maintaining the sports relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive
liberty cited as their target date as it coincided with the need to renew commercial agreements with the teams and the end of the seven year cycle of engine development that started in 
on august it was announced that all teams had signed the new concorde agreement
this came into effect at the start of the season and changed how prize money and tv revenue is distributed
when i get out of the car of course im thinking as well is this something we should do travel the world wasting resources?
—sebastian vettel four time champion voicing concerns on formula ones impact on climate change
formula one has launched a plan to become carbon neutral by 
by all events should become sustainable including eliminating single use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused recycled or composted
in january fia and formula one signed the united nations sports for climate action framework
after the signing was announced fia president jean todt said as an international federation comprising members in countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development we are fully committed to global environmental protection
the signing of this un sports for climate action framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our federation for many years
since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in f to the creation of the environment and sustainability commission the entire fia community has been investing time energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations
we aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards
from the season all cars will increase the bio component of their fuel using e fuel rather than the % of ethanol currently used
this percentage is expected to grow again in the future
in december the fia claimed that it had developed a fuel with % sustainability to be used in formula one from either or when new engine regulations come into force
prior to the beginning of the formula one world championship f announced and launched the #weraceasone initiative
the initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on grand prix weekends as well as the creation of a formula task force that will listen to people from across the paddock  and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in formula at all levels
the move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport
the year history of the world championship has been dominated by european and white drivers with the first and only black driver winning the world championship in 
in addition to organization wide measures individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sports cultural and political activism
during the season the mercedes amg petronas f team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately % of its workforce was white
due to the results of the study the team changed the cars livery to promote anti racism messages and also launched the accelerate programme
the program vows that approximately % of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until 
the drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track
following the murder of george floyd in the summer of all twenty drivers wore end racism shirts and took part in an organised anti racism protest during the pre race formalities
in the year since lewis hamilton has remained vocal in his pre race attire with other drivers occasionally wearing change demanding clothing
specifically sebastian vettel sported a rainbow colored shirt with the words same love ahead of the hungarian grand prix in an effort to bring awareness to hungarys anti lgbt law
see also list of formula one broadcasters formula one can be seen live or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences
the season attracted a global audience of million people per race
the cumulative television audience was calculated to be billion for the season broadcast to territories
during the early s formula one group created a number of trademarks an official logo an official tv graphics package and in an official website for the sport in an attempt to give it a corporate identity
tv stations all take what is known as the world feed either produced historically by the host broadcaster or by formula one management fom
the host broadcaster either had one feed for all or two separate feeds a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers
the one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents while the two feed approach meant that replays for when returning from an ad break and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected
the only station that differed from this set up was df re branded to premiere then to sky deutschland a german channel which offers all sessions live and interactive with features such as the onboard and pit lane channels
this service was purchased by bernie ecclestone at the end of and became f digital plus which was made more widely available around europe until the end of when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much
on january f announced that it would adopt the hd format for the season
it was announced on july that sky sports and the bbc would team up to show the races in f from to 
sky launched a dedicated channel sky sports f which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions along with f programming including interviews archive action and magazine shows
in the bbc broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season
the bbc ended its television contract after the season three years earlier than planned
the free to air tv rights were picked up by channel until the end of the season
sky sports f coverage remained unaffected and bbc radio live and live sports extra coverage was extended until 
as of bbc radio and live has rights to such coverage until 
while sky sports and channel are the two major broadcasters of formula other countries show formula one races
many use commentary from either sky sports or channel 
in most of asia excluding china the two main broadcasters of formula one include the fox network and star sports in india
in the united states espn holds the official rights to broadcast the sport while abc also holds free to air rights for some races under the espn on abc banner
in germany austria and switzerland the two main broadcasters are rtl germany and n tv
in china there are multiple channels that broadcast formula one which include cctv tencent guangdong tv and shanghai tv
currently in france the only channel that broadcasts formula one is the pay tv channel canal+ having renewed its broadcasting rights until 
the official formula one website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time
an official application has been available for the apple app store since and on google play since that shows users a real time feed of driver positions timing and commentary
on november formula one unveiled a new logo which replaced the previous flying one in use since 
in march fom announced the launch of f tv an over the top ott streaming platform that lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary
currently the terms formula one race and world championship race are effectively synonymous
since every formula one race has counted towards the world championship and every world championship race has been run to formula one regulations
however the two terms are not interchangeable
the first formula one race was held in whereas the world championship did not start until 
in the s and s there were many formula one races that did not count for the world championship eg
in a total of twenty two formula one races were held of which only six counted towards the world championship
the number of non championship formula one events decreased throughout the s and s to the point where the last non championship formula one race was the race of champions
the world championship was not always exclusively composed of formula one events the world championship was originally established as the world championship for drivers ie
without the term formula one in the title
it only officially became the fia formula one world championship in 
from to the indianapolis race counted towards the world championship
this race was run to american automobile association and later united states automobile club championship car regulations rather than to formula one regulations
only one of the world championship regulars alberto ascari in started at indianapolis during this period
from to all races counting towards the world championship except the indianapolis were run to formula two regulations
formula one was not changed to formula two during this period the formula one regulations remained the same and numerous non championship formula one races were staged during this time
the distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all time lists
for example in the list of formula one drivers clemente biondetti is shown with a single race against his name
biondetti actually competed in four formula one races in but only one of these counted for the world championship
similarly several indianapolis winners technically won their first world championship race though most record books ignore this and instead only record regular world championship participants
in the earlier history of formula one many races took place outside the world championship and local championships run to formula one regulations also occurred
these events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the world championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship
in the early years of formula one before the world championship was established there were around twenty races held from late spring to early autumn in europe although not all of these were considered significant
most competitive cars came from italy particularly alfa romeo
after the start of the world championship these non championship races continued
in the s and s there were many formula one races which did not count for the world championship in a total of twenty two formula one races were held of which only six counted towards the world championship
in and when the world championship was run to formula two regulations non championship events were the only formula one races that took place
some races particularly in the uk including the race of champions oulton park international gold cup and the international trophy were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders
other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship such as the syracuse and danish grands prix although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower formula cars to make up the grid
these became less common through the s and saw the last non championship formula one race the race of champions at brands hatch won by reigning world champion keke rosberg in a williams cosworth in a close fight with american danny sullivan
