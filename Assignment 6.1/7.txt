read our privacy noticewas there ever a stranger kind of glory than that which finally eluded lewis hamilton so close to the grave of his boyhood hero ayrton senna?
not it has to be said within the borders of anything that might be described loosely as competitive sport
right up to the final act in sao paulo there was a sense that the year old from hertfordshire was being led lap by relentless lap along a plotline that the hierarchy of formula one had scripted out of deference to his phenomenal arrival part star part prophet of a sport that so badly needed reinvigoration after the departure of michael schumacher
sure fernando alonso a double world champion and kimi raikkonen had the talent and the competitive edge to make an intriguing battle of the schumacher succession and there were some new young dashers on the scene nico rosberg son of a world champion and brimming with speed genes and some said that the pole robert kubica was just a truly competitive car away from making his own dazzling mark
but then in the opinion of such ageing titans of the track as sir stirling moss and sir jackie stewart there was something unique about the smiling kid from stevenage who like his idol senna had come to live for the adrenalin that floods in when you are racing not for career progress but to announce that you are quite simply the best in the world
that hamilton should have come so close to such a status so quickly so seamlessly that he has been able to restrict his mistakes to such a bare minimum and then when they came to treat them not as harbingers of failure but the merest passing inconvenience is the reason we now have to cut our way through the extraordinary background of the industrial espionage and £m fine inflicted on his team mclaren
it is why we have to say that along with the asterisk which must accompany all of hamiltons wins this season there is something that has been written quite indelibly
it is that moss and stewart are doing something more than recognising mere passing celebrity and a fortuitous set of circumstances which made hamilton not a breath taking prospect but a cold hard certainty to be a key figure in the sport which has obsessed him since his toddling days
if it is impossible to celebrate all perhaps even a majority of the circumstances that have shot him to such prominence it is not reasonable to challenge the unswerving reality that has accompanied him to the podium so many times this benighted season
it is that quite relentlessly he has displayed the quality which separates all the outstanding achievers in any sport from the rest
he is a young man of durable brilliance
his ambition is a still pool that apparently cannot be disrupted
so many rocks have been hurled into it in the last month or so but the surface remains as smooth as a glacier
yes there is an icy quality to young lewis
people talk about his easy and uncomplicated charm but then with what authority?
how well does anyone really know lewis hamilton?no doubt his father and patron anthony is the expert and his pleasant open face locks into rock jawed resolution when he declares people have wondered whether lewis would crack in the hard times which come to every competitor but i try to tell them that when they ask the question they reveal that they just dont know himhe has lived his life with one thing in mind to be where he is now and you can be sure he will never be easily deterred or distractedyes i accept that the real test comes when you get the bad breaks but he has a few of these now and he has just got strongerhamilton rides crisis with such apparent ease he might be piloting the family car to the supermarket
in brazil these last few days he has been emphatic that the disaster in shanghai where a shredded tyre left him stranded in the pit lane and still another race away from the world title has been no more than a psychological flesh wound
i did wonder how it would affect me but i can say honestly it has left me strongerwhile his rival alonso has erupted from one bout of rage to another railed against his team on occasion no doubt with some reason hamilton has never shown the hint of an inclination not to play the party game
but then why would he?
from the first races of the season he became the self elected chosen one of formula one
he wasnt learning a trade at its most demanding level he was engulfing it with an innocent but overwhelming ambition and natural talent
now some of that innocence has been lost along with the shredded tyre and the occasional points
hamilton knows he is favoured knows too that he is equipped to take advantage
so there we had him before yesterdays race exchanging pleasantries with the rival alonso he was supposed to hate
nothing had changed in their relationship he declared and if you could believe that you could believe anything including the outrageous proposition that a year old rookie could do in a few months something that eluded the brilliant moss in a lifetime of technical brilliance and unsurpassable courage and nerve
yesterday was his deepest test so far but whatever its outcome hamilton slipped easily into his cockpit with the knowledge that no one in his sport had travelled so far remotely as quickly
that he has done so in a sport which has so systematically shed itself of credibility that operates in a permanent state of civil war and appalling compromise he makes it almost uncannily appear to be somebody elses dirty business
he is the star with a garbo like inclination to be left alone even threatening to exile himself in switzerland on all occasions except those that come with the job
his homage to senna over recent days has been in several ways a journey into a new world
he said he had been touched to be staying just a short distance from his heros tomb
this suggests a little of the mysticism that was such a part of the brazilians fanatical pursuit of success yet there has been little previous evidence in hamilton of anything other than an unbreakable practicality in dealing with his situation
he had arrived whatever the outcome of yesterdays racing at the place he had always wanted to be and whatever compromises had been involved they had been smoothed away each time he drove off in what has been often the fastest car on earth
frequently senna declared that he drew his strength directly from god
hamilton no doubt would confess to having influential friends a little closer to home
but there is a reason for such preferment and it flows from something more than the lottery of being picked out from the pool of young drivers who each year present themselves as desperately as casual fruit pickers for employment
it is that lewis hamilton has more than special talent
he has an implacable belief in himself
without that his story would hardly make sense
last race losers other britons who lost in the final event of the world championship stirling mossthe greatest driver never to win the world championship actually saw his hopes dashed at the final hurdle a few times but never more cruelly that in the moroccan grand prix in 
moss needed to win the race and hope his countryman mike hawthorn finished worse than runner up
the former he duly did while hawthorn seemed booked in for third
but moss knew he was beat as in second was phil hill hawthorns ferrari team mate
hill pulled over let hawthorn take second and the crown and so deny the most popular british driver of all time
jim clarkbefore winning seven out of the races to clinch his first crown in clark the flying scotsman had to endure the agony of losing out to his rival graham hill the previous year
after a ding dong season it came down to the last grand prix in south africa
what made it worse for clark was that only an oil leak on the nd lap denied him
clark took it badly before bouncing back the next year
graham hill had felt the last race agonies at the hands of john surtees in but four years later was back at the same mexico track holding his nerve to break another young scots heart
stewart had shown just how good he was with a peerless victory in the torrential rain at the nurbringing but the wily hill proved too experienced for him with a nerveless final day triumph
nigel mansellthe biggest hard luck story of all
mansell arrived at adelaide with a six point lead over alain prost a seven point lead over nelson piquet and only needed to finish third in his williams honda
all was going well with laps remaining and then a wheel blew up
it was like a bomb going off said mansell who took a long time to recover from the disappointment
in the event prost prevailed
damon hillthe race that spawned one of the biggest controversies in f history hill was the unlucky loser
the englishman just needed to finish ahead of michael schumacher who had just a one point lead going into adelaide and when he went to overtake the german on the th lap it appeared the championship was his for the taking
but then schumacher collided with hill and both were forced out of the race
the arguments raged as to whether schumacher did it deliberately

eddie irvineafter ferraris appeal reinstated the ulstermans win in the preceding grand prix in malaysia to gave him a three point lead the stage was set for a first tifosi triumph for years in suzuka
however mika hakkinen dominated the race to seal the title with irvine forced to settle for a distant third place and runner up spot in the championship
it was the nearest the garrulous irvine ever got to the title
