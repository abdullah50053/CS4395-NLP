after narrowly shading lewis hamilton throughout a tense and intriguing race in belgium vettel heads to italy with confidence “i believe we have the best car in terms of overall package
there’s still something missing but the guys in maranello are very motivated
i think we have done the biggest improvement and a big step forward
now we turn the page on and move on to monza let’s see what happens there” at silverstone in july mercedes had the clear upper hand and it was believed that on low downforce venues such as spa francorchamps the silver arrows pair would be untouchable
although lewis hamilton did qualify on pole and win on the day to narrow the points gap to seven from it was very very close at the front between the title contenders on race pace
vettel explained “we didn’t change too much compared to silverstone which shows on the one hand that silverstone was just a bad weekend but we also improved the car especially on race pace we are very strong” “i mean we were on average a second off or nearly a second off in silverstone so it’s a big step
i’m very very happy
i think the positive thing is that we had very good race pace
it was very difficult to follow in the middle sector but we stayed close and then we benefit in the first and last sector
overall the car was very good” “i think we are on the right track and i don’t think we have a circuit we should fear going from now” said vettel who scored his maiden grand prix victory at monza in as a red bull driver and also won at ‘la pista magica’ in and for red bull
