# Assignment 9

## Overview

For this assignment, I selected the paper [The Moral Debater: A Study on the Computational Generation of Morally Framed Arguments](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.601/) from the Long Paper Proceedings of the 2022 ACL conference and wrote an analysis of the paper. 

## Abstract:
> An audience’s prior beliefs and morals are strong indicators of how likely they will be affected by a given argument. Utilizing such knowledge can help focus on shared values to bring disagreeing parties towards agreement. In argumentation technology, however, this is barely exploited so far. This paper studies the feasibility of automatically generating morally framed arguments as well as their effect on different audiences. Following the moral foundation theory, we propose a system that effectively generates arguments focusing on different morals. In an in-depth user study, we ask liberals and conservatives to evaluate the impact of these arguments. Our results suggest that, particularly when prior beliefs are challenged, an audience becomes more affected by morally framed arguments.
