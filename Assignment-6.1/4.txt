tech talk explains all ‘i loved every second of my f debut’ logan sargeant takes you behind the scenes in his exclusive new fcom column vowles says williams will decide on power unit supplier for this year discover more news there’s a revolution coming in formula in and it’s shaped… well much like the car you see in the image above
here are the key things you need to know about the game changing car a full scale model of which broke cover at the british grand prix

it’s been designed specifically to promote better racing the regulations originally slated to arrive in but delayed by covid had one guiding principle to allow closer racing with the potential for more overtakes a happy but secondary benefit
gallery a first look at the life size f car after drivers get up close at silverstone what’s preventing closer racing currently?
the effect of the catastrophic downforce loss to quote an engineer centrally involved with the project resulting from the ‘dirty air’ being churned chaotically off a leading car currently
to put some numbers on it research shows that current f machines lose % of their downforce when running three car lengths behind a leading car approximately metres measured from the lead car’s nose to the following car’s nose while closing up to one car length around metres results in a % loss
the car developed by formula s in house motorsports team in collaboration with the fia and putting a heavy onus on the aerodynamic phenomenon known as ‘ground effect’ more on which later… reduces those figures to % at metres rising to just % at metres

the car will feature over wheel winglets for the first time and wheel covers are back!
two of the striking features on the car are its over wheel winglets and a return to a feature last seen in f in wheel covers
the inclusion of the latter is simple sending airflow through the wheels might be an enormously potent way for teams to increase their downforce but it also adds to that chaotic aerodynamic wake coming off the cars
read more a new era begins watch as the full size f car is unveiled for the first time although there have been changes to the regulations to limit what teams can do around the tyres aerodynamically f’s motorsports team wanted to take a belt and braces approach by adding a physical seal to prevent engineers intentionally directing disruptive airflow out through the wheels
as for the over wheel winglets their job is to help control the wake coming off the front tyres and direct it away from the rear wing
that’s been a role traditionally performed by vortices from the front wing but in a way that makes them hugely sensitive when running in following car conditions
the winglets will achieve the same thing but in a way that is more aerodynamically resilient in close racing
over wheel winglets and wheel covers are two key features on the car 
the car will feature inch low profile tyres for the first time f fans will have recently seen lots of footage of teams testing pirelli’s bigger inch tyres in readiness for next year
the new pirelli compounds and constructions for these inch tyres have been designed with the goal of reducing the amount the tyres overheat when they slide a primary aspect that should help with closer racing
read more hamilton tries out inch tyres at imola the lower profile tyres also have the added benefit of reducing the sidewall deflection changes and the resulting aerodynamic wake effect that occurs
the teams spend a lot of effort on simulating the airflow regimes around the tyre shapes and interactions with the car bodywork
reducing the sensitivity in this area will be a benefit in both the car design process and resource required something thats particularly important in the era of the cost cap
lewis hamilton testing the new inch pirellis 
the front wing and nose concept have been completely re thought although front wings have been getting progressively simpler in recent seasons the f car will feature a totally new front wing shape
keeping with the philosophy of the car the new front wing’s job is to both generate consistent downforce when running closely behind another car and ensure that the front wheel wake is well controlled and directed down the car in the least disruptive way
read more ways the rules will improve f that means not sending the wake dramatically outboard as is done on the current cars nor letting it spill under the floor and get ingested by the diffuser but instead steering it narrowly down the side of the car as much as possible
or as one engineer on the project put it the car’s front wing is designed simply to be an anti outwash front wing
fun fact f’s motorsports team did initially carry out investigations into running the car without a front wing at all before deciding against it
the front wing is designed to prevent outwash 
an aero feature from the s is back!
sort of f’s motorsports team began work on the car back in and it soon became apparent that the key change required to ensure closer racing would be placing the aerodynamic emphasis on ground effect to create downforce
ground effect came to prominence in f in the late s with cars effectively designed in the shape of upside down airplane wings creating huge amounts of downforce as they were pushed into the track
watch how the f car was developed full ground effect cars were subsequently outlawed at the end of and the car is certainly not a return to that era there are no side skirts for a start!
but the car does feature fully shaped underfloor tunnels rather than the stepped floor used currently which will allow teams to generate large amounts of efficient downforce through ground effect the current floors also exploit ground effect but not to the same extent
the reason for the change is the benign quality of downforce generated in ground effect
current cars’ barge boards and other bits of aerodynamic furniture are designed to send vortices under the floor to increase downforce
but when those vortices stop working due for example to the influence of closely following another car the performance drop off is huge
with the car however the underfloor downforce is better preserved within the tunnels without the reliance on arrays of wake sensitive vortex generating geometries ergo better following ergo closer racing!
the car isnt a return to the ground effect era of the late s and early s 
the rear wing features new ‘rolled tips’ that rather beautiful art deco looking rear wing on the car an automotive stylist contributed to aspects of the car’s overall look incidentally actually has an important function and it’s to do with mushrooms
let us explain… while current cars’ rear wings direct airflow upwards they are also designed to send flow outwards leaving the ‘dirty air’ sitting there for the following car to drive through
by contrast the shape and position of the car’s rear wing creates a rotational airflow that collects the rear wheel wake and rolls it into the flow exiting the diffuser forming an invisible ‘mushroom’ shaped wake
this narrower wake is then thrown thanks also to a steeper diffuser ramp high up into the air allowing a following car to drive through less disrupted ‘clean air’
drs remains on the rear wing meanwhile with the motorsports team keen to study its effect in conjunction with the rule changes

it will use the same power unit as many many things are new on the car but the power unit is not one of them with formula set to retain the current 
litre turbo hybrid units
this is no bad thing given that they’re already the most advanced and most efficient engines on the planet
there will however be some more standard components in the fuel system as well as some additional sensors to allow the fia to better monitor the power units
the big change is actually what will be coursing through those 

cars will run on more sustainable fuel current regulations see cars running on fuel containing % bio components
and while f is still working hard to introduce fully sustainable fuel in the near future will see the bio component ratio rise to %
that will be achieved through a move to ‘e fuel’ ‘e’ standing for ethanol while ‘’ refers to its percentage in the mixture
crucially though that ethanol must be a second generation biofuel made in a sustainable way meaning it will have a near zero carbon footprint an “interim step” in the words of formula ’s chief technical officer pat symonds which will also help the sport align with current road car fuel regulations
read more how formula will lead the charge to use biofuels the cars will run on e fuel 
safety has been at the forefront of the design it almost goes without saying that a new generation of formula cars comes with the opportunity to make the sport even safer and that’s certainly the case with the car
the chassis now need to absorb % and % more energy respectively in the front and rear impact tests as well as greater forces in the static ‘squeeze’ tests required to homologate the chassis and certify their strength
lessons have been learned too from recent major crashes including that of romain grosjean at the bahrain grand prix with the cars now designed in such a way that in the event of a crash the power unit will separate from the chassis in a safe manner without exposing the fuel tank
david tremayne grosjean’s shocking accident will only spur efforts for even greater f safety meanwhile learnings from the fia’s investigation into formula racer anthoine hubert’s fatal accident at spa in were also incorporated principally a longer nose section to help dissipate energy in a crash together with stronger chassis sides to resist t bone incidents
it’s also true that those safety improvements as well as the heavier and more robust tyres have seen a weight increase with the minimum car weight having risen by around % from kg currently to kg
lessons from romain grosjeans bahrain grand prix crash were incorporated into the car 
the car has been put through over simulations to get to this point f is nothing if not a thorough sport and as you can imagine creating the car has not been a ‘finger in the air’ exercise
instead f’s motorsports team have run approximately simulations creating around half a petabyte of data
that’s the equivalent of a third of the billion photos on facebook or million four drawer filing cabinets full of text documents

please update your the car was also developed in exclusive sessions in sauber’s wind tunnel in switzerland with ‘baseline configurations’ experimented with over two years with around ‘wind on’ hours
read more for more news features and technical insight on the car click here meanwhile the teams have also been granted regulatory freedom to test the current car iteration or the ‘uniform’ baseline as it’s known internally given that it’s the st significant update for methodology development in their wind tunnels and cfd provided they don’t alter the shape with the feedback from the teams having been a crucial part of the design and development process
and there you have it the key things you need to know about the car
f’s motorsports team are confident that they’ve come up with a set of regulations that can achieve their objective of closer racing while not being so prescriptive that they prevent creativity
now we just have to wait and see what the teams come up with in time for pre season testing  this feature is currently not available because you need to provide consent to functional cookies
