whilst vettel drove a classy campaign there were occasions where eventual champion hamilton ascended to truly generation defining greatness en route to his fourth world title
his latent superiority was at times truly astounding
beyond the title charging duo treated the fans to some truly astonishing driving feats
it was a season where an exasperated double champion went into pr mode where the sport’s young prodigy set his sights on an imminent title tilt where force india’s young recruit showed his potential and where daniel ricciardo’s patented brand of overtaking became f’s unofficial postcard image
it was another season of vintage performances from f’s racing gladiators # sergio perez beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin 
perez was the stronger force india on average in but it didn’t stop him getting rattled by his new young team mate
on many weekends the mexican was the class of the midfield almost unmatched over a race distance and increasingly formidable on saturdays having put the lessons of partnering single lap specialist hulkenberg to good use
he put himself ahead of his team by not ceding to ocon in canada and he allowed the backdrop of his rivalry with the frenchman to bubble over in belgium
a pair of costly collisions with ocon were entirely the mexican’s fault
overall perez’s experience probably should have afforded him a bigger buffer to his team mate
he had the pace to keep a lid on ocon in but the trajectory of the mercedes protege looks ominous for 
# esteban ocon beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin +
following on from a rather ambiguous tenure at manor where he often struggled to match wehrlein ocon announced his f arrival in and rewarded force india’s confidence with a fantastic campaign
despite his tender years he was the cream of a star studded midfield on a number of occasions an assured p on his team mate’s home turf was particularly impressive
he let his enthusiasm get the better of him in baku and in committing the ultimate inter team sacrilege he also cost himself a realistic shot of victory
however the mid season fracas with perez was also a marker of the excellent job ocon was doing
predominantly looked to announce the frenchman as a superstar in the making
# carlos sainz jr beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin 
as the bridesmaid to verstappen’s promotion to red bull sainz has nonetheless succeeded in bolstering his own reputation in the meantime
carlos produced some truly classic drives in scintillating in the mixed conditions in china fast on the twisty layouts of monaco and hungry and levelheaded on slippery streets of singapore
there were errors too he torpedoed stroll in bahrain and caused first lap carambolage in canada
however points on his debut for renault was a mark of sainz’s prevailing confidence
he is a man on an accelerating upward trajectory and how the reputable spaniard compares to hulkenberg’s blistering speed promises to be a fascinating subplot in 
# valtteri bottas beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin +
as the man stepping into the shoes of the reigning champion and as the apparent lamb to the slaughter partnering an imperious lewis hamilton valtteri bottas’ first season at the top table in f was an imposing challenge
and yet the finn enjoyed a superb first half of the season and crossed a number of personal rubicons in scoring his first pole and victory
a clean and combative recovery drive at silverstone was particularly impressive
it all went downhill after the summer break and bottas would scarcely lap within six tenths of hamilton’s mighty run of pole positions
he tended to be quicker on less abrasive circuits but that didn’t stop him being outshone by vettel in brazil
a victory on merit in abu dhabi was a much needed confidence builder however bottas will need to be more consistent in to avoid suffering same fate of hamilton’s last finnish team mate
# nico hulkenberg beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin 
hulkenberg’s reputation has suffered at the hands of perez in the past two seasons however with a fresh challenge spearheading renault’s factory backed venture the german produced his best campaign since 
he was particularly supreme in qualifying and could often be relied upon to snap at the heels of the red bulls when he connected all the dots
his final q laps in bahrain and silverstone are easily among the finest laps of the season
a costly crash in baku was one of the few loose ends in a season where the german’s professionalism showed with mega performances on track and pivotal developmental feedback off track
if hulkenberg can deliver more banzai performances like his superb drives at silverstone singapore and yas marina nico will be well on his way to fully salvaging his former notoriety
# daniel ricciardo beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin +
for a man with an eminent reputation for single lap pace a bruising defeat in qualifying at the hands of verstappen is an alarming snapshot
certainly there were strong performances and eponymous dan dare lunges but in a season where ricciardo’s predicted title assault was derailed by car pace and unreliability he also struggled to match his team mate when things were equal
the aussie’s residual class still shone through in but it was a disappointing year by any measure
# sebastian vettel beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin 
vettel showed his class in 
stellar qualifying laps formidable race pace and decisive overtaking manoeuvres catapulted the german into his first title assault in red overalls
an accomplished batch of victories and impressive recovery drives in shanghai and montreal kept vettel’s nose ahead in the championship
’s title assault looked to further integrate vettel into his relatively new home and for much of the season he looked to be leading ferrari from the helm
but for an inexcusable moment of madness in baku and a misjudged start in singapore ferrari’s main man could have taken the title fight to the final round
however whilst vettel excellently showcased his considered and cerebral approach his campaign was one of relentlessness there were few moments of true brilliance
his title nemesis on the other hand… # max verstappen beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin 
verstappen’s fable is already completely unprecedented however in f’s prodigy went to new heights
for much of the season the dutchman didn’t look so much like a star in the making but a star that had very much arrived
having left his teens behind him max would collect a superb pair of victories in malaysia and mexico and would spend the entire season wringing the neck of his red bull
his racecraft was always superb but in verstappen expanded his arsenal to markedly eclipse his team mate in qualifying
there were ragged edges he eliminated ricciardo and hungary and suffered a clumsy tangle with massa in monza but for the most part the year old looked nothing less than a man who will inevitably be fighting for a championship soon
# fernando alonso beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin 
alonso’s self promotional ethos served him well in it fanned his inner fire in spite of honda’s ongoing travails saw him excel on a cameo showing at the indy and overall resulted in the spaniard’s finest season in five years despite his mcl being chronically unreliable and virulently underpowered he did not struggle to impress the paddock thanks to a steady supply of banzai qualifying laps and his iconically tenacious brand of racecraft
it was a typically formidable campaign but one with a renewed vigour and electricity
it is encumbered on renault and on f to provide such a mighty driver with a more competitive package for 
alonso might have been the quickest man out there this season but we wouldn’t have known
# lewis hamilton beat team mate in qualifying beat team mate in race laps spent ahead of team mate qualifying margin 
hamilton by no means enjoyed a perfect season in however bald patches in sochi and monaco and a mistake in qualifying in interlagos cannot deny the irrefutable brilliance that garnished his performances throughout the season
in qualifying in hamilton was truly peerless pole laps in silverstone spa and in the pouring rain in monza are surely among the finest of his record breaking tally
his racecraft was also outstanding a thirty lap stint on soft rubber in barcelona in which he passed the medium shod vettel should not have been possible
his run of demolition in the wake of the summer break was arguably a rendering of one of the most complete and invincible drivers the sport has ever seen
fans and pundits may feel more comfortable admitting it once lewis retires but the brit is clearly heading for legendary status
