# Assignment 6

## Overview

This program is an introduction to web crawling and web scraping. It uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to crawl and scrape the web. 
The program takes a URL as input and outputs the links on the page, scrapes the text off of those links, cleans the text, and outputs the text to a file.

It then uses the `nltk` library to tokenize the text and output the top most common words to a file, from which a knowledge base of facts is created and pickled.
