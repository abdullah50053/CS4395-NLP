it needs fresh blood
not some dinosaur blocking the position
sonly years overdue but very welcome all the same
jplease please can we now have competitive racing back?hopefully i will return to excitedly watching every race on tv and visiting silverstone again
cconfused year old man found wandering the corridors of media company moved into nursing home after being unable to explain what he was doing thereathis man got off a bribery charge by bribing the court
glad to see the back of him
band about time too!
!his malignant hand removed from the tiller at last should have been years ago
dcontemptible little man has sucked the sport dryubye bye bernie!
you are past it mate take a deep breath and get over it
why the car manufacturers have entertained this sport parasite as much as they did i will never understand
xyes thanks bernie for making f so commercial it has lost the essence of motor sport denying millions of viewers from seeing it through greedy deals with pay for view companies pricing out historic grands prix and circuits crucifying small teams through an unfair distribution of wealth allowing technology & health & safety to take the motor out of the sportbye bye bernieropportunity for racing & innovation surely?grand prix based on tyres designed to self destruct kerbs which mean nothing and run off areas which are hard surfaced has killed racing in fbroadcast it on a channel that people can access and it might come back to life!sthank god hes gone!
address the unfair distribution of payments to teams and circuits
allow enough money to be distributed so we can have or even more teams on the grid
let the drivers race and if they crash they crash
remove the stupid fuel saving get rid of the aerodynamics that prohibit cars to follow one another at high speed
bring f back to terrestrial tv
then f will roar again
nsometimes people dont know when to move on
bernie has been overdue on that for a while
good to hear that ross brawn is on board

sthe reason why bernie is universally hated by all is his arrogance and refusal to listen to anyone
the only ones who dont openly show their dislike are the spineless cowards in the paddock who suck up to him fearing his wrath if they speak their minds
ihe should be in jailsgreg maffei id like to thank bernie ecclestonein building this remarkable global sport
ill just correct that for himgreg maffei id like to thank bernie ecclestone in building this remarkable money making extravaganza lfantastic for years took over taking the sport from countries with s of fans to countries with not many but mucho money leaving terrestrial tv is already starting to bite very short sighted bernie stayed years too long and is a legend in his own lunchtime he would read these comments and not care what f fans think  there lies the problem with his f managementufrom what i hear directly from someone who was part of the inner circle of a f team some years ago ecclestone is more of a crook than blatterathanks for everything bernie but a change was long long overdue
hoping this is the start of something exciting for fbshould be in prison with sepp blatter!
