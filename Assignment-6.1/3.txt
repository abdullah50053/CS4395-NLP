in racing terms formula implies a pure racing car a single seater with open wheels — a format largely unconnected with and unrecognisable from road cars
formula one implies that this is the ultimate in formula racing
formula one and the baby formulas that came later the reason why the sport is called formula one is rooted in history
pioneer motor racing placed no limitations on the size or power of the competing cars
with technological advances this free for all quickly made for ludicrously dangerous conditions — especially as the early races were fought out on public roads
as a result the governing body of the sport at the time began imposing key limitations on the format of the cars in terms of power weight and size
only cars complying with this formula of rules could compete
the rules of grand prix racing have adapted to the technology and needs of the times
the rules formulated for racing immediately after world war ii were given the tag of formula one a name that has stuck ever since
formula two was invented shortly afterwards as a junior category with a smaller engine capacity
not long after that formula three came into being for even smaller single seaters
the formula two name was dropped in the mid s and replaced by formula denoting the cubic centimeter capacity of the engines

if illogical and inconsistent labelling bugs you motor racing is not for you
the premiere racing sport in the world formula one stands at the technological pinnacle of all motorsport
its also the richest most intense most difficult most political and most international racing championship in the world
most of the worlds best drivers are either there or aspire to be there and the same goes for the best designers engineers engine builders and so on
its a sport that takes no prisoners under achievers are spat out with ruthless lack of ceremony
formula one takes its position at the top of the motorsport tree very seriously
formula one traces its lineage directly back to the very beginnings of motor racing itself at the end of the nineteenth century when public roads were the venues
all other racing series have sprung up in its wake
unlike most racing categories formula one isnt just about competition between the drivers
its about rivalry between the cars too
the technology battle between teams is always an ongoing part of formula one
comparing formula one and other types of racing racing in america for a time overlapped in its development with european racing then it veered off in the direction of oval track racing
cart and irl racing in america formula racing in america became indy car racing spawning the cart and irl series of today
these cars look like formula one cars to a casual onlooker but a formula one car is lighter more agile and more powerful
another difference is that formula one cars never race on ovals instead they race on purpose built road racing tracks or street circuits
furthermore each formula one team designs and builds its own cars rather than buy them off the shelf from a specialist producer
nascar and touring car racing non formula road car based racing spawned nascar in america and touring car racing in the rest of the world
both are for cars that from the outside look like showroom road going models but which underneath the skin are very different
nascar tailors to american production models and races mainly — though not exclusively — on ovals
touring cars are based on european or australian road cars and like f cars race on road racing or street tracks
the feeder formulas in europe feeder formulas to formula one — where drivers team owners designers and engineers can all hone their craft on the way to formula one — developed
today these are classed as formula and formula 
the names and numbers have changed over the years but formula one remains what it has always been — the pinnacle
f is currently for single seater cars with engines based on road going production cars not exceeding liter capacity
f is for single seaters powered by a specific liter racing engine defined by the governing body
the structure and hierarchy of motor racing is extremely complex and not very logical
all you really need to know is that in global terms formula one is at the top of the pyramid
