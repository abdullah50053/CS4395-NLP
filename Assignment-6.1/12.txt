can the quadruple world champion help the heavily revamped scuderia and himself back into the winner’s circle?
or will team mate kimi raikkonen recapture past glories in a car whose front end works the way he likes?
and will alonso likewise turn around mclaren’s fortunes as honda come back into f racing for the first time since ?
or will the two time champion be upstaged by jenson button?
how long will the team’s teething troubles last?
with felipe massa and valtteri bottas maintaining the consistency at williams will all of them be able to hold a candle to the mercedes of world champion lewis hamilton and the hungry nico rosberg as the german vows to be even stronger than he was last year?
at the same time sensation daniel ricciardo will be partnered by sophomore rising star daniil kvyat at red bull
will the australian continue the hugely impressive form with which he surprised the world as he thoroughly overshadowed vettel or will it be his turn to be upstaged by the highly rated russian?
meanwhile down at toro rosso two of the most promising rookies in recent years max verstappen and carlos sainz junior add another fascinating dimension to the driver market
both are quick and like kvyat last year are set to leave a mark
at sauber felipe nasr makes it two brazilians in f racing while will stevens adds a third british driver at the phoenix like marussia team
and three other britons will have chances to shine as test and reserve drivers susie wolff and alex lynn at williams and jolyon palmer at lotus
for the second time in history there will be races in a season as mexico makes a welcome return to the calendar for the first time since using a revised version of the famed autodromo hermanos rodriguez in mexico city
the virtual safety car has been approved for and may be initiated to neutralise a race upon the order of the clerk of the course the rule changes after heavy lobbying from the ferrari and renault powered teams who suffered from the two companies’ failure to build competitive engines for the new formula the fia was able to identify and exploit a loophole despite understandable opposition from mercedes who did far and away the best engineering job with the new powertrains and deserved to clean up whereby ferrari and renault were able to bypass the agreed engine development freeze and make changes to their hardware to help close up the field
the new powertrains had to be homologated by february th with no further development allowed to the end of the season
but the rules only stated that the engines had to be homologated without specifying a date
thus ferrari and renault and mercedes should they wish had longer to develop their powertrains than the end of february
each manufacturer is allowed a stipulated number of tokens which cover different aspects of the engines and they are thus free to keep developing them until they have no tokens left whereupon they can homologate the unit for the season
changes to the technical regulations include another increase of the minimum weight which rises from kg without fuel to 
interlinked suspension is banned under rules dictating that the front suspension must react only to changes in load applied to the front wheels and likewise for the rear suspension
the zylon anti intrusion panels on both sides of the survival cell have been extended upwards to the rim of the cockpit and alongside the driver’s head the zylon anti intrusion panels on both sides of the survival cell have been extended upwards to the rim of the cockpit and alongside the driver’s head in response to jules bianchi’s accident and there have been further limitations in the governance of wind tunnel testing and the aerodynamic reporting periods for and 
additionally the fia have revised the penalties for using more than the allotted allocation of power units in a single season which has dropped from five to four
changing a full powertrain will no longer incur an automatic penalty
instead penalties will be cumulative based on the individual components of each power unit
if a grid place penalty is imposed and the driver’s grid position is such that the full penalty cannot be applied the remainder of the penalty will be applied in the form of a time penalty during the race instead of rolling over to the following race as another grid penalty
among changes under the sporting regulations the qualifying procedure has been clarified with eligible cars five will be excluded after q and q the controversial double points season finale is no more and after consultation with the teams the proposed use of standing restarts after safety car periods has also been dropped
and following successful trials in the final races last year the virtual safety car has been approved for 
it may be initiated to neutralise a race upon the order of the clerk of the course and will normally be used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of track and competitors or officials may be in danger but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself
if a race is suspended the pit exit will be closed and all cars must now proceed slowly into the pit lane not the starting grid
too close to call so will it be another two horse race between hamilton and rosberg with the rest breathlessly trying to keep up?
or can williams get closer still after their impressive challenge with red bull and ferrari also reducing the deficit?
it’s always hugely difficult to assess pre season testing with complete accuracy thanks to vagaries such as chassis set up engine settings and fuel loads but the work teams did in jerez and barcelona since january suggests that mercedes are still some way ahead but that williams ferrari and red bull are closely matched and mclaren honda are in trouble
here’s our assessment of each team based on their winter performance

mercedes “it’s a work in progress but of course it feels great” world champion lewis hamilton says
“you know it’s great to see all the work that’s gone in by the team and throughout testing it’s felt really good
generally it’s been pretty awesome” nico rosberg who did the most distance of anyone km against hamilton’s as mercedes topped the list with says it’s been a great winter for us
we got off to a running start with not many reliability problems and have been doing the mileage which was great and important
now we are able to extract performance from the car” and both drivers admit that they didn’t quite nail the set up to go really fast in barcelona… mercedes did however have a few reliability and driver health issues after jerez
hamilton lost time with a fever which stopped him running and left young reserve pascal wehrlein to drive as rosberg nursed a strained neck
hamilton also had a worrying mgu k failure on the final day of testing
but if you look at the on track performance of the sleek new f w hybrid you couldn’t blame pundits for predicting another head to head battle between hamilton and rosberg as the rest trail behind them
red bull while renault have made some progress red bull have made it clear it isn’t enough and there were unhappy faces when a motor problem hampered testing in jerez
then kvyat took off the only front wing early on when he took over forcing the team to run without it way off the pace
things got better in barcelona once software gremlins were eradicated and reliability was good enough to enable both drivers to complete some race simulations
the rb looked good out on the track as one would expect of a rob marshall car in which adrian newey has still had a significant influence but driveability shortcomings remain in the renault powertrain and the company admits things won’t be perfect in the opening races
it remains to be seen how long it takes renault in particular to help the team get into the anticipated best of the rest fight with williams and ferrari in mercedes’ wake
williams winter work in grove has focused on honing what was a very competitive package and the indications on track are that the fw has better traction and aerodynamics while retaining the low drag characteristics that made the fw so quick in a straight line in 
other areas that have received the most attention are operational notably pit stops and strategic planning the benefits of which won’t be seen until the racing starts
testing has gone very well as the team initially resisted any temptation to grandstand while getting the grunt work out of the way and when massa and valtteri bottas did get going they were both very fast
not mercedes fast it must be said but they seem very well placed to continue the progress they made in and to remain mercedes’ strongest challenger to begin with
ferrari ferrari raised many eyebrows and sent cynicism needles into the red when they showed tremendous pace in jerez at the start of testing
their subsequent form in barcelona wasn’t quite so impressive and they have yet to reach mercedes level performance but their dramatic improvement is on the radar of both lewis hamilton and nico rosberg and williams red bull and mercedes all say they expect the red cars to be at the sharp end of the battle
there were some minor issues with sensors and new boy sebastian vettel’s embarrassing cold tyre spin at the start of his first day in barcelona but otherwise the winter has been a massive fillip for the scuderia which went through such a traumatic season
the sf t has a much better engine and seems to have a very strong front end to kimi raikkonen’s delight and the chances are that the finn will put up a much better showing against vettel than he was able to against alonso in 
that means ferrari should have two cars consistently in the thick of things
rosberg is on record saying that ferrari have made the most improvement of any team and williams certainly expect them to be trouble as their pace all but matched the martini liveried cars on the supersoft tyres

mclaren returnees honda were always going to be on their back foot playing catch up with teams that went through all their teething troubles this time last year but nobody could have foreseen just how tough their testing programme would be
a raft of technical glitches limited mileage in jerez and the car lacked pace then the barcelona tests were characterised by ongoing problems with seals on the mgu k component in the ers
throw in hydraulic and oil leaks and sensor problems in the final test which severely limited mileage mclaren’s tally for all three tests was only km and it was small wonder that racing director eric boullier suggested that mclaren are percent behind where they expected to be
as if all that wasn’t enough there was alonso’s accident in the first barcelona test and the subsequent brouhaha and the medical imperative which will see the spaniard miss the opening race
thus the picture emerges of a team that has a very long way to go before it starts to satisfy either dennis or honda on their f return
on the positive side when reserve driver kevin magnussen who will replace alonso in australia gave his feedback on the new car he was very enthusiastic about the modifications wrought by the arrival of former red bull aerodynamicist peter prodromou
he was called up late in the day after alonso’s shunt and only managed laps in the second barcelona test before an oil leak brought him to a halt
but in that time he learned enough to express an opinion that lifted spirits
the first feeling on low ish fuel was very good and very consistent he said
it was very stable with no surprises
last years car was a bit more unpredictable and it’s nice to see the work we did last year and the direction we wanted to go has definitely proved to be right for this car
it definitely feels like a completely different car
it’s very consistent very predictable and very smooth in
just driveable” the aim was not necessarily to maximise downforce but to make what downforce there is more consistent and predictable and they seem to have succeeded with that
honda’s engine is still at an early stage of its development as a race unit
observers’ favourite description during the testing was “unrefined” and there were suggestions that its lack of systems reliability prevented the team from running anywhere near full power
but aspects of it impressed magnussen who of course compared it to the mercedes powertrain he used last year
i was quite surprised about the torque delivery and upshifts he said
although there is still some way to go i was surprised how smooth it was
pleasantly surprised” force india the team had done a little bit of running with the vjm on which the new car is necessarily based but it was clearly a major relief when the new car managed an impressive km in the hands of sergio perez and nico hulkenberg when it finally got going
that’s almost what mclaren achieved in all three tests
hulkenberg said that there is never any substitute for mileage while perez admits that they are probably two steps behind the opposition and said he expects it could take until the fifth race before that lost ground can be made up
assuming that others don’t take steps forward in the meantime… toro rosso thereafter however they were both able to get the hammer down in barcelona
sainz crashed in turn not long after alonso during the first week blaming high winds in that corner
that drama aside the team amassed km as the new boys learned all about qualifying and race simulations tyre performance and pit stops
the str ran in launch guise for the first two tests before what amounted to an all new aero spec was ready for the third and final session
there still seem to be traction and handling issues to address but as team boss franz tost eyes fifth place overall toro rosso’s chances of making a strong start to the year look good
lotus last year missed testing really hurt a team that were very tight on budget now things are better though the new car was a day late running in jerez
in a turn of events that must have reminded some of last year’s travails with renault they ran into problems with the powertrain and telemetry but things were better in barcelona where a run on pirelli’s supersoft tyres gave grosjean the week’s fastest lap in the first test
both drivers say the car is a big step forward over the unliked e even though an unidentified brake failure on the final day of testing in barcelona put maldonado into the wall at turn 
how far back up the order the team can get in its revamped state will be one of the fascinations of the season in which they start as the darkest horse
marussia sauber sauber got their campaign with the new c off to a great start with fast times in the jerez test but nobody was fooled as rookie felipe nasr was quickest on the third day and he and new team mate marcus ericsson finished second on the other days
after the problems with the c in last year’s pointless challenge that was encouraging but hardly an accurate reflection of the pecking order
since then the car has as expected slipped down the ranks
but it’s been reasonably reliable and bar the silly collision between nasr and susie wolff on the first day of the first barcelona test and then some mechanical issues sauber didn’t lose much track time thereafter
things went well in the final barcelona test and they were able to do a lot of race running and there was general intra team satisfaction with progress even though the car looked a little twitchy out on the track
the swiss team could be in a good position to score points and avoid a repeat of
