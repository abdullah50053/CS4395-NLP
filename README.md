## Summary

The CS 3395 class at UT Dallas has taught me many skills in NLP, including data preprocessing, natural language understanding, text generation, sentiment analysis, tokenization and lemmatization, classification, Probabilistic Syntactic Grammars (PSG), Dependency Parsing and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), web crawling and scraping, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, deep learning model variations (RNN, CNN, etc.) and embeddings.

NLP is a very interesting field, and what I learned in this class and the projects I made are only scratching the surface. There is so much more I can do with NLP, and I have a few future project ideas that can leverage the techniques I used in class to create a more powerful version of the project I initially was thinking of. One example is to add a chatbot to my personal portfolio that can answer questions about myself or any of the projects I have showcased. 

Keeping up in this field is very important as we are living in a pivotal moment in history where NLP is being used consciously by consumers more than ever, and it will only become more widespread from here. Some ways to keep up is to subscribe to newsletters and keep up with research papers that are published, such as those from the 2022 ACL conference. With all this in mind, it is also worth considering a future employment opportunity in the field as there is considerable growth potential in the field and it is still in its early stages of catching on.
