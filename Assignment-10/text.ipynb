    "Overall, the deep learning techniques that were used poorly predicted the sentiment of a Yelp review based on the training data. Both accuracy and loss were not very good, the model took a very long time to train, and crashed several times due to using up all the available RAM both on my local machine as well as on Google Collab. The best result was attained from the Sequential model, while the others all crashed the machine I was working on, even after reducing the test and training data sizes significantly. I ran the others independently and got results that had an accuracy in the high 20% area. In the future, further preprocessing of the data, along with tweaking the number of epochs and other parameters could lead to better results. "
