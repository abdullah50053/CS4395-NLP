So the 2023 Formula 1 season is up and running after the Bahrain Grand Prix kicked things off – and the F1 Nation gang are here to pick apart all the big talking points from the race in the desert.
Tom Clarkson and Natalie Pinkham are on hand to bring you all the reaction from Bahrain and in today's podcast they hear from man of the hour Fernando Alonso, who had the biggest smile in the paddock after racing to a brilliant podium finish on his debut for Aston Martin.
Team Principal Mike Krack's smile was almost as big as Alonso's and he talks through their race, while Lance Stroll recounts his incredible recovery from pre-season injury to a top 10 finish.
The gang also chat with race winner Max Verstappen, fresh from getting his title defence off to the best possible start – but it wasn't all plain sailing for Red Bull, as the team’s Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey reveals that there were "unexpected problems" for them to fix before their dominant 1-2 finish, with Sergio Perez following Verstappen home.
Elsewhere, Ferrari find reasons to be optimistic despite a race-ending problem for Charles Leclerc, and Mercedes reserve driver Mick Schumacher takes us inside a team with "work to do" – with George Russell and Lewis Hamilton failing to challenge the frontrunners – and explains how it feels to sit on the side-lines.
Williams rookie Logan Sargeant reveals what he learned from his first F1 race weekend, and at AlphaTauri, Yuki Tsunoda is targeting points at the next race in Saudi Arabia after just missing out in Bahrain.
