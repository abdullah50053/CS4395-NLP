Kimi Raikkonen will get back behind the wheel of a racing car later this month, with the 2007 F1 world champion set for another outing in the NASCAR Cup Series at a track close to his heart.
Raikkonen has agreed terms to drive Trackhouse Racing’s PROJECT91 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 at the Circuit of The Americas, where the Finn claimed the last of his 21 F1 victories in 2018.The March 26 event will mark Raikkonen’s second Cup Series race  at Watkins Glen International last August – qualifying 27th and running in the top 10 for most of the afternoon before getting caught up in a late-race accident.“I had a fantastic time in NASCAR.
There was a lot to learn in a very short amount of time, but everyone was very helpful, the competition was a big challenge,” said Raikkonen ahead of his next outing.
This tweet has been removed from Twitter“This time I get to race on a track I am familiar with so there won’t be as steep of a learning curve.
I want to have fun, but also do as well as we can.”Trackhouse Owner and Founder Justin Marks added: “When we announced Kimi last year I said he was the global superstar I had in mind when we created PROJECT91.“I think you saw the fan reception across the world and Kimi’s performance in the car was proof of the concept.
Kimi’s following is massive and it’s great for NASCAR, Trackhouse plus I think Kimi really enjoys our racing.”Prior to his Cup Series outings, Raikkonen competed in the Xfinity and Truck Series races at Charlotte Motor Speedway back in May 2011.
